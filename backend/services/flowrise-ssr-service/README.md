### Slice Machine

-   a tool that allows you to build and edit slices in your project
-   think of Slice Machine as a craftsman workshop where you can create and shape your data models all while reaping benefits like Git versioning, component previews and auto-generated mocks.
-   within it you have 2 main types of data models: 1. Types (Page and Custom Types) and 2. Slices
    -   1. Types
        -   Page Types serve as templates to create documents - these documents typically correspond to pages on your website, if not we use Custom Types
        -   Custom Types can represent a multitude of elements such as navigation menus, side-wide settings, blog posts, authors, etc.
    -   2. Slices
        -   reusable components that can be used in multiple documents
        -   made up of a set of fields that can be filled in by content writers
        -   page sections that can be added, removed, and reordered in the Prismic editor

### Prismic Slice Machine Troubleshooting

#### Error: "It seems like you donâ€™t have access to this repository"

-   Solution: Make sure you are logged in to the correct Prismic account and have access to the repository you are trying to access
-   RUN: `yarn prismic login` to login to the correct account
    -   NOTE: if you miss the prismic cli, install it with `yarn add prismic-cli`

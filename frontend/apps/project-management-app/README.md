## About

-   component driven design with close resemblance to Atomic Design for easy scalability and maintainability - everything with scalability in mind
-   TailwindCSS for styling as it is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs and it is highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
-   form validation with data binding, error handling and form submission with reactive UI and UX
-   leverage TS for type safety and code readability
-   use of HTML native `<dialog>` to build modals and leverage React's `createPortal()` to render the modal outside of the DOM hierarchy of the parent component, `forwardRef()` to pass refs to child components and `useImperativeHandle()` to expose imperative API to parent components and `useImperativeHandle()` to expose imperative API to parent components and in the end build reusable components

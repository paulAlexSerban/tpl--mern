# Architecture Design Journey: v2 - v3
1. **Problem**
   - identify clearly
2. **Learn**
   - architecture approaches
   - architectural and design patterns
   - principles and best practices
3. **Design**
   - fill Design Toolbox with new knowledge
   - design initial version 
4. **Adapt**
   - apply software tools
   - implement application frameworks
   - add databases
5. **Evaluate**
   - what is wrong with this architecture?
   - how can we improve the current design?

## V3
### Problem: High level of coupling and dependent layers
#### Understand the problem
Problems:
- layers are highly coupled and depend on each other
- code organization is hard to maintain
- locking of frameworks that are hard to change

Solution
- Clean Architecture
- The Dependency Rule

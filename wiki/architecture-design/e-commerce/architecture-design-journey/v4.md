# Architecture Design Journey: v2 - v3
1. **Problem**
   - identify clearly
2. **Learn**
   - architecture approaches
   - architectural and design patterns
   - principles and best practices
3. **Design**
   - fill Design Toolbox with new knowledge
   - design initial version 
4. **Adapt**
   - apply software tools
   - implement application frameworks
   - add databases
5. **Evaluate**
   - what is wrong with this architecture?
   - how can we improve the current design?

## V3
### Problem: High level of coupling and dependent layers
#### Understand the problem
Problems:
- layers are highly coupled and depend on each other
- code organization is hard to maintain
- locking of frameworks that are hard to change

Solution
- Clean Architecture
- The Dependency Rule

Add New Non-Functional Requirements
- for Layered Architecture -> Maintainability
- for Clean Architecture -> Flexibility & Testability

### Learn: Clean Architecture
- separates the elements of a design into circle levels
- was created by Robert C. Martin and promoted on his blog
- it helps organize code and encapsulate the business logic
- it promotes keeping the core business logic and application domain ar the center of the solution structure that is independent of presentation and data access layers
- Clean Architecture is divided into two main elements:
  - Policies: the business rules and procedures
  - Details: implementation code to carry out policies
- Clean Architecture focuses on the policies and business logics that build on project requirements
- the internal layers contains the business rules and has no dependency on any third-party library

#### The Dependency Rule of Clean Architecture
> this is the main principle of Clean Architecture
- Rule: The dependencies of a source code can only point inwards.
  - code dependencies can only move from the outer levels inward
  - code on the inner layers can have no knowledge of functions on the outer layers
  - inner layer cannot have any information about elements of an outer layer
  - classes, functions, variables, data format, or any entity declared in an outer layer must not be mentioned by the code if an inner layer

#### Layers of Clean Architecture
1. Entities
- encapsulate 
2. Use cases
3. Interface Adapters
4. Frameworks and Drivers

# State Management

## What is State Management?
- the process of maintaining knowledge pf an application's inputs across multiple related data flows that form a complete business transaction - or session - to understand the condition of the app at any given moment
- state can also be described as the collection of preserved information that forms a complete session or transaction
- from a practical point of view - the state of an application is represented by the data being delivered to and produced by the application
- state management makes the state of an application visible in the form of a data structure, improving the developers' ability to work with the app
- state management libs provide developers with the tools needed to create the data structures and change them when new actions occur

## FE vs BE State Management
### FE State Management
- the user's own app maintains the programs state
- the user UI connection ensures the user and the application are in harmony throughout the session

### BE State Management
- the application component uses an external data structure or database to maintain the state of the application or record the final state when it's is done processing activities
- the state variable in the data structure can also sync the user interface - and through it the user - with the sate of the session

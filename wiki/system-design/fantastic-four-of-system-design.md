# Fantastic Four of System Design
Who are the Fantastic Four of System Design? 
 
Scalability, Availability, Reliability, and Performance. 
 
They are the most critical components to crafting successful software systems. 
 
Letâ€™s look at each of them with implementation techniques: 
 
1. Scalability 
Scalability ensures that your application can handle more load without compromising performance. 
 
2. Availability 
    Availability makes sure that your application is always ready to serve the users and downtime is minimal. 
 
3. Reliability 
    Reliability is about building software that consistently delivers correct results. 
 
4. Performance 
    Performance is the ability of a system to carry out its tasks at an expected rate under peak load using available resources.

# Health Check and Monitoring Scripts

-   Purpose: Monitor the database for performance, connectivity, or issues such as deadlocks, slow queries, or disk space usage.
-   Use Case: Ensures the database is performing optimally and detects issues before they escalate.
-   Tools: Custom scripts using database APIs, cloud-based monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus), or self-hosted solutions like Grafana.
-   Example: A script that checks if any queries are taking longer than a threshold and sends an alert.

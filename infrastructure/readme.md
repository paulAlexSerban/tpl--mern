# Tips for Managing Infrastructure in a Monorepo:

-   **Environment Separation**: If you have multiple environments (like development, staging, production), consider structuring your Kubernetes configs to reflect these environments, either through directory structure or naming conventions.

-   **Access Control**: Ensure proper access control and security practices are in place, as infrastructure configurations can be sensitive.

-   **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation within the /infra directory to guide developers on how to use and update these configurations.

-   **CI/CD Integration**: Consider how these configurations integrate with your CI/CD pipelines and whether there are specific pipelines for deploying infrastructure changes.

-   **Versioning and History**: Keep infrastructure code versioned alongside your application code. This way, changes to infrastructure can be tracked and managed with the same rigor as application code changes.

## Versioning infrastructure code

Versioning infrastructure code is crucial for maintaining stability, reproducibility, and traceability in your software development lifecycle. Here are some best practices for versioning infrastructure code:

### 1. **Use Source Control**

-   **Practice**: Treat infrastructure code the same as application code by storing it in a version control system like Git.
-   **Benefits**: Enables tracking changes, reviewing history, and reverting to previous versions if necessary.

### 2. **Branching Strategies**

-   **Practice**: Adopt a branching strategy (like Git Flow or Trunk-Based Development) for managing changes in your infrastructure code.
-   **Benefits**: Helps in managing different environments (development, staging, production) and facilitates collaborative development.

### 3. **Commit Messages and Change Documentation**

-   **Practice**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages and document significant changes in the code.
-   **Benefits**: Provides context for changes, making it easier for team members to understand the history and rationale behind changes.

### 4. **Tagging and Releases**

-   **Practice**: Use tagging to mark releases or significant changes. This can align with your application's release cycle.
-   **Benefits**: Makes it easy to identify and revert to specific versions if issues arise.

### 5. **Change Management Process**

-   **Practice**: Implement a change management process, including code reviews and approval for changes to infrastructure code.
-   **Benefits**: Ensures code quality, minimizes the risk of errors, and promotes knowledge sharing among team members.

### 6. **Automated Testing**

-   **Practice**: Incorporate automated testing for your infrastructure code (like testing Terraform plans).
-   **Benefits**: Catches errors early, ensures code quality, and increases confidence in the deployment process.

### 7. **Environment Parity**

-   **Practice**: Strive for parity between different environments (development, staging, production) in terms of infrastructure setup.
-   **Benefits**: Reduces "it works on my machine" issues and improves reliability of deployments.

### 8. **Immutable Infrastructure**

-   **Practice**: Prefer immutable infrastructure patterns, where changes are made by replacing infrastructure rather than modifying existing components.
-   **Benefits**: Enhances consistency and reliability, as each change creates a new version of the infrastructure.

### 9. **Version Pinning**

-   **Practice**: Pin versions of external dependencies (like Docker images, Terraform provider versions) to avoid unexpected changes.
-   **Benefits**: Prevents breaking changes in dependencies from impacting your infrastructure unexpectedly.

### 10. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

-   **Practice**: Integrate infrastructure updates into your CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Benefits**: Enables regular, automated testing and deployment of infrastructure changes, ensuring a consistent deployment process.

### 11. **Security as Code**

-   **Practice**: Include security configurations and checks as part of your infrastructure code.
-   **Benefits**: Integrates security into the development lifecycle, ensuring that infrastructure is compliant and secure from the outset.

### 12. **Regular Audits and Refactoring**

-   **Practice**: Regularly audit and refactor your infrastructure code to improve efficiency, remove redundancies, and apply best practices.
-   **Benefits**: Keeps the infrastructure codebase clean, efficient, and easier to maintain.

### Conclusion:

Versioning infrastructure code is about more than just keeping track of changes; it's about ensuring the stability and reliability of your infrastructure. By applying these best practices, you can create a robust, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure that aligns well with your application development processes.
